# The chatbot app ships in two flavors, selected by `app_mode`:
#   "simple" (default) — the basic chat-only experience. Requires nothing below.
#   "pro"              — adds a dockable workspace panel with an interactive
#                        knowledge-graph view, a data explorer, an embedded Genie
#                        + AI/BI dashboard, and a richer "thinking" stream.
#
# Pro mode reads the optional resources below. Leave them as-is for simple mode.
# The deploy notebook (06b_deploy_chatbot_app_pro_OPTIONAL) injects these into the
# app as environment variables; they are all harmless no-ops in simple mode.

# GraphRAG is exposed to the Supervisor as SQL Unity Catalog functions

# MCP proxy on streaming requests (httpx ResponseNotRead; see ML-63338), whereas UC
# function tools register reliably. See 05b (creates the functions) and 04 (wires them).
